AIM : To Chat with Website Using RAG Pipeline


The goal is to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that allows users to
interact with structured and unstructured data extracted from websites. The system will crawl,
scrape, and store website content, convert it into embeddings, and store it in a vector database.
Users can query the system for information and receive accurate, context-rich responses
generated by a selected LLM.
